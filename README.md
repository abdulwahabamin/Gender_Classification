# Gender_Classification
We have data regarding a person's height, weight and shoe size. We would like to make a classifier which predicts the gender of a new person using this data. We have used four different classifiers for this purpose:

1. Decision Tree Classifier
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Logistic Regression
4. SVC (Support Vector Classifier)

We implement these four different classifiers on our dataset using the built-in functions in scikit-learn python library and figure out which classifier gives us the maximum accuracy.
